Several dissemination activities were created and organised to increase awareness and teach researchers the basic knowledge and skills about privacy.

## Online module Privacy basics for researchers

We created an online module "<a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/walk-in-hours-workshops/privacy-basics-online-training" target="_blank">Privacy basics for researchers</a>", a self-paced online module on Utrecht University's Moodle platform that takes about 1,5 hours to complete. This module aims to give researchers a basic understanding of the General Data Protection Regulation in a research context. The module focuses on the following topics:

- Chapter 1: Personal data, sensitive personal data, roles in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Chapter 2: Legal basis in research, informing data subjects, data subjects' rights
- Chapter 3: Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default, privacy scan, Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), privacy risks, data breach
- Chapter 4: Data security, access control, encryption, pseudonymisation, anonymisation, tools
- Chapter 5: Storing and sharing personal data, making personal data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)

The module is open for everyone with a Utrecht University Solis-ID, although external researchers can also be added manually. Furthermore, the module <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7930571" target="_blank">materials are openly shared (CC-BY)</a>, so that others can reuse (parts of) the module.

## Other dissemination activities

Other dissemination activities have included and will include:

- Presenting the project's deliverables to support staff within and outside of Utrecht University.
