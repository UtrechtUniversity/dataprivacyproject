During the entire Data Privacy Project, we want to take into account the perspective of our target audience: the researchers. What data privacy issues to they run into? What are their data privacy needs? How can we best help them? 

To answer these questions, we have set up a survey and are meeting individual researchers to hear about their experiences and needs. This will give us both quantitative and qualitative feedback on the entire project, as well as an evidence base to base our next steps on.

## Results
The survey was sent out in March 2022. Since then, we have started to analyse the results and meet with researchers from all faculties to hear their stories. All documentation and results resulting from these efforts can be found via the <a href="https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacysurvey" target="_blank">dedicated webpage</a> and <a href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/dataprivacysurvey" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
