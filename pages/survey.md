## What?
During the entire Data Privacy Project, we want to take into account the perspective of our target audience, the researcher. What data privacy issues to they run into? What are their data privacy needs? How can we best help them? 

To answer these questions, we are setting up a survey in the form of both a questionnaire as well as individual interviews with researchers. This will give us both quantitative and qualitative feedback on the entire project, as well as an evidence base to base our next steps on.

## For whom?
We will interview and send the questionnaire to researchers within Utrecht University.

## How?
Since the process of conducting the survey may in itself be seen as a small research project, our workflow looks very similar to that of a regular research project:
1. Planning, including data management, privacy, ethical and legal considerations and communication
2. Create a question bank, together with the team, as a list of important questions that we can extract questionnaire and interview questions from
3. Create the questionnaire and interview questions and pilot test them
4. Collect questionnaire responses and conduct interviews
5. Document (clean, summarize, perhaps publish) the findings
6. Interpret the findings and determine next steps
