## What?
During the entire Data Privacy Project, we want to take into account the perspective of our target audience, the researcher. What data privacy issues to they run into? What are their data privacy needs? How can we best help them? 

To answer these questions, we are setting up a survey in the form of both a questionnaire as well as individual interviews with researchers. This will give us both quantitative and qualitative feedback on the entire project, as well as an evidence base to base our next steps on.

## For whom?
Our target audience is all researchers at Utrecht University.

## Status
Since the process of conducting the survey may in itself be seen as a small research project, our workflow looks very similar to that of a regular research project:
1. We finished preparations, including writing a Data Management Plan and Privacy notice, registering the survey in the university processing register setting Communication in motion
2. We finished a question bank, together with the team, as a list of important questions that we could extract questions from
3. We created the questionnaire and will soon start drafting interview questions
4. We will soon start collecting questionnaire responses and conducting interviews
