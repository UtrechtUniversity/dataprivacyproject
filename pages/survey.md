During the Data Privacy Project, we wanted to take into account the perspective of our target audience: the researchers. What data privacy issues did they run into? What were their data privacy needs? How could we best help them? To answer these questions, we set up the Data Privacy Survey, an online questionnaire and one-on-one meetings with researchers to hear about their experiences and needs.

## Results
The Data Privacy Survey was sent out in March 2022 and resulted in two reports: one describing the results, and one with recommendations (see links above). All survey-related materials can be found via the <a href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/dataprivacysurvey" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>, and the reports have also been <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7253451" target="_blank">archived on Zenodo</a>.
