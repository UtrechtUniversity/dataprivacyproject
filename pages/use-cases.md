## What?
In order to develop solutions that can be of practical use to multiple research projects, we aimed to take on use cases. These are examples of research projects that needed help tackling a privacy-related issue. The desired solution could be of any type, from de-identification workflows and agreement templates to software solutions for secure data sharing or pseudonymization. Importantly, the to be developed solution should be reusable for other projects.

## Why?
By taking on use cases and developing tools for them, we could help researchers with common privacy-related needs, and at the same time create a reusable solution for others to use in the future.

## Results
This deliverable has resulted in the following:

- A Python package was (further) developed to pseudonymize personal data based on a predetermined key-value pair: <a href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/anonymouus" target="_blank">AnonymoUUs</a>
- The ODISSEI Social Data (SoDa) team collaborated with Research Engineering on a Python package to create synthetic data based on a generated metadata file: <a href="https://github.com/sodascience/metasynth" target="_blank">MetaSynth</a>.
- We listed examples of already taken approaches as Use Cases in the <a href="https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook/pet-survey.html" target="_blank">Data Privacy Handbook</a>.
