I"<p>The Data Privacy Project is a data support project within Utrecht University, the Netherlands. The aim of this project is to develop knowledge, tools, and experience of how researchers can and should deal with personal data, with an emphasis on pseudonymization and anonymization techniques and tools. At the moment, knowledge about this appears limited or at best, scattered - both among researchers as well as research supporters. This is likely because different disciplines or projects encounter different issues and/or approach them from different angles. Moreover, there is more personal data in scientific research than previously thought, and questions about translating privacy-related legislation into practical guidelines are getting more and more ubiquitous and complex.</p>

<p>The specific project goals are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>🧠 Create a knowledge base and an overview of available tools for researchers to learn about handling personal data. The <a href="deliverables/dataprivacyhandbook">Data Privacy Handbook</a> forms the basis for this this deliverable.</li>
  <li>🛠️ Realize or expand a number of tools to solve concrete problems of research projects in this area. For this, we will take on <a href="deliverables/use-cases">use cases</a> that are typical of various privacy-related questions.</li>
  <li>🔍 Perform qualitative and quantitative <a href="deliverables/survey">investigations</a> into the current practices and needs of Utrecht University research staff concerning the handling of privacy-sensitive data.</li>
  <li>💪 Develop various <a href="deliverables/dissemination">training materials</a> for researchers and support staff about dealing with personal data and the use of the available tools.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all goals mentioned above, we want to collect information that is FAIR, practical and actionable. Therefore, we are working together with privacy professionals, researchers and everyone in between to get a perspective that is as widely supported and applicable as possible.</p>
