## What?
The Data Privacy Handbook is an open-source, community-driven Handbook about handling privacy-related issues in research data. It consists of a knowledge base, an overview of privacy-enhancing techniques and tools and use cases to draw inspiration from. The aim is to make it as practical and actionable as possible, without going into too much unnecessary detail.

## For whom?
The Handbook is aimed primarily at researchers, but may also be useful for data support staff, such as data managers and privacy officers. 

## Why?
Current knowledge about privacy law, privacy-related tools and practical strategies to enhance privacy are greatly scattered. At Utrecht University alone, there is a <a href="https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledge-base/privacy-at-uu" target="_blank">knowledge base</a> on the intranet, information on the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/guides/handling-personal-data" target="_blank">RDM support website</a> as well as scattered information gathered by data supporters at different faculties, which differ in their depth and practical usefulness. With the Data Privacy Handbook, we aim to summarize all this knowledge and tools into **one central place**, which users can use to get started with data privacy. By having a curated, actionable resource that outlines the basics of data privacy, we hope to additionally reduce the burden on support staff. They can then shift their focus towards meeting more complex privacy-related needs.

## How?
We aim to make the process of creating the Handbook as open as possible and to include as many voices as we can. We therefore welcome contributions of any kind, for example:
- fixing typos
- suggesting edits or new (parts of) chapters
- discussing the content
- contributing resources (articles, websites, learning materials)
- spreading the word about the Handbook
