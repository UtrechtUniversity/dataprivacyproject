## What?
When we are well on our way within the Data Privacy Project, we will start compiling everything we found into existing and new dissemination materials. In other words: we'll be spreading the word on Data Privacy! 

## How?
Methods of dissemination one can think of are:
- Creating a generic Data Privacy workshop for researchers and/or support staff
- Compiling or creating training materials to use for self-study, based on the Data Privacy Handbook
- Presenting the findings to researcher communities (e.g., Open Science Community) and/or the (inter)national data support community
- Organizing a new support structure in the form of privacy champions, a data privacy network, etc.
