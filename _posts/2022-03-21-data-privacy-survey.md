**How do you deal with privacy-sensitive data in your research and how can we best support you? Whether you are a PhD candidate or a professor, we would like to hear from you!**

Research Data Management Support is currently running the **<a href="https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyproject" target="_blank">Data Privacy Project</a>**. This project aims to improve how we support researchers in handling privacy-sensitive data (hereafter: "personal data"). We do this, for example, by developing information materials and tools that can help in this respect. To tailor our efforts to researchers' needs and experiences, we want to give you the opportunity to give your opinion in this survey. 

The survey takes about **10 minutes** to complete, and you can pause and continue the survey later. This link will lead you to the survey:

The survey touches upon the following topics:
1. How are you currently dealing with personal data in your research? 
2. What challenges do you run into while handling personal data?
3. Your suggestions on how we can improve our services on handling personal data in research.

You can find more information about the survey in the <a href="https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyproject/assets/docs/survey-privacy-statement.pdf" target="_blank">Privacy statement</a>.
